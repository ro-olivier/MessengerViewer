## MessengerViewer

Work in progress.
The idea is to :
  - have a Python script parse the JSON data downloaded from Facebook (cleaning it up and formatting the right way)
  - build a dataviz page with D3js and display : message per user and chars per user (donut chart) and messages count (with a stacked area chart) across a selectable time frame (using a double-selector slide). The dataviz should also allow toggling on/off a user as well.
